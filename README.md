This Telegram_news_bot.py for news about the G20 countries. After the "/start" command, you can start a dialogue with the Telegram bot.

Then you can select the number of news items you want to receive. At the end you must write "news" to get the Telegram bot to send you news with your requests in mind. However, if you write another word in place of "news", you will get a certain picture that you definitely want to see. If you want to create your own Telegram news bot, you will need to get the api_key for Telebot and NewsApiClient. If you want to talk to my Telegram bot, use @News_around_the_world_bot.
